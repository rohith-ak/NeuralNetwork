# NeuralNetwork
Regression and classification using neural network

Introduction
The Notebook file  has 2 projects. The description of the projects are mentioned below.

      Project #1 context:: 
            A company that makes communications equipment has a product that is responsible for sending out informative messages. The company wants to create a machine learning model that will allow them to forecast the signal quality of their equipment based on a variety of parameters.

      Project #2 context::
            Recognizing multi-digit digits in street-level pictures is a crucial part of modern-day mapmaking. Google's Street View imagery, which consists of hundreds of millions of geo-located 360-degree panoramic photos, is a classic example of a corpus of such street-level shots.
The ability to automatically transcribe an address number from a geo-located patch of pixels and associate it with a known street address aids in pinpointing the location of the building it represents with a high degree of precision. The optical character recognition community is interested in recognizing numerals in photos in general. 
While OCR has been explored extensively in confined areas such as document processing, unconstrained multi-character text recognition in pictures remains a difficult task. This problem emerges as a result of the great range of fonts, colors, styles, orientations, and character layouts used in the wild to create the visual look of text.
Environmental elements such as lighting, shadows, specularity, and occlusions, as well as image acquisition characteristics like as resolution, motion, and focus blurring, exacerbate the recognition challenge. We'll use the dataset with images centered around a single digit for this project (although many of the images do have some distractors on the sides). Although we are taking a sample of the data which is simpler, it is more complex than MNIST because of the distractors.



Project #1 ::
Data description ::
The data set contains information on various signal tests performed:
1. Parameters: Various measurable signal parameters.
2. Signal_Quality: Final signal strength or quality

PROJECT OBJECTIVE :: 
The need is to build a regressor which can use these parameters to determine the signal strength or quality [as number].


Project #2 ::
## Data description ::
The SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and object recognition algorithms with the minimal requirement on 
data formatting but comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real-world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images


PROJECT OBJECTIVE ::
Digit classifier on the SVHN (Street View Housing Number) dataset.
